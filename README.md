**The Ultimate Credential Cracking System**

---

## What is Juggernaut?

Juggernaut is a next-generation password cracking platform that outperforms traditional tools like John the Ripper and Hashcat by combining AI, hybrid hardware acceleration, and a cloud-native architecture.

---

## Key Selling Points & Advantages

- **AI-powered attack engine**: Learns from breached databases, generates context-specific rules, and combines brute-force, Markov, and smart mutations.
- **Hybrid, high-performance architecture**: Simultaneously leverages CPU (SIMD/AVX), GPU (CUDA/OpenCL), FPGA, and cloud resources.
- **Polymorphic cracking kernels**: Dynamically generates and dispatches optimized code for each hash type and device.
- **Dynamic load balancing**: Smart scheduler distributes work across all available hardware, including cloud.
- **Cloud-native & distributed**: Offload jobs to AWS Lambda, GCP Functions, or other cloud platforms for massive scale.
- **Universal hash support**: Auto-detects 150+ hash types, including blockchain and biometrics.
- **Smart resume**: State saved every 5s, survives crashes and power-offs.
- **Stealth/OpSec features**: TOR integration, memory-only execution, zero-disk, decoy traffic, covert packet scheduling.
- **Ethical use & auditability**: Enforces restricted, ethical use with license acknowledgment and cryptographically signed logs.
- **Extensible & modular**: Easy to add new hash algorithms, attack modes, or hardware/cloud backends.
